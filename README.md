Portfolio for Advanced GIS Sp2022
# AboutMe
  I am a second year masters student at CMU. I enjoy traveling, reading, and eating lots of good 
  food! My favorite restaurants in town are Bahn Mi and Ti, and Morcillas in Lawrenceville! I don't 
  drink coffee but I am a BIG tea drinker.
  
# What I hope to learn
  
  I really enjoyed my intro to GIS class i took in the fall semester of 2021. I am really interested in
  exploring spatial in/justice and I think this class will allow me to expand on my current skills and learn
  some new ones to be able to conduct high-quality analyses.

Question: "Where you you see using Notebooks in the future?  How might you expand your own use of ArcGIS Pro to better leverage some of the more advanced graphing capabilities in the software?"

Notebooks in ArcGIS is an exceptional tool that I plan to use quite frequently in my graduate research studies. Much of my research will include spatial analysis/ spatial data science so having the ability to write code that can be reused and tailored to different kinds of analyses will be incredibly beneficial. I found it particularly useful to be able to review and edit data within the notebook once you create a feature class to visualize the data. I am planning to use notebooks in my final project which will be a very preliminary analysis of the research I plan to conduct during my PhD. 

Pros of Notebook

    this tool allows people who are conducting advanced GIS research to do so more efficiently by writing code and editing data
    copying and tailoring analyses without having to manually go through all of the steps/functions in ArcGIS Pro
    sharing the code and analyses with partners/clients for them to conduct similar research

Cons of Notebook

    It requires a pretty medium to advanced knowledge of python. I only have taken one introductory python class but I believe if I wanted to really utilize all the functions and capabilities of Notebook I would have to take another class or self-teach myself python

Where Notebook is Applicable

    Unless you are highly skilled in python and/or how to use all of the capabilities of ArcGIS notebook I wouldn't recommend using it for basic map making/analysis in ArcGIS Pro
    When conducting analyses that alig more with spatial data science and advanced quantitative analysis OR having to repeat similar analyses multiple times with different data I believe Notebook would be especially useful


Question: "Did working through the exercise give you a broader understanding for how decision trees and the forest-based method work, and what a predictive model tries to do?  Can you imagine using the Forest-Based Classification and Aggregation tool in a real-world scenario?"

I am actually really excited to know about this feature, as this will be incredibly useful for future research projects. At first I was a bit confused as I was visualizing the decision trees we discussed in ManSci 3, but I do now see their similarities. This exercise helped me get a better understanding of decision trees from both a management science perspective and now a spatial analysis perspective! From my understanding, individual decision trees create a certain predictive model and the Forest-Based method tool aggregates all of these decision trees to create a single prediction based on the validity of the training data. Esri makes it really easy and relatively user friendly to do pretty advanced analysis because of all of the back-end work ArcGIS does. This allows users who aren't necessarily familiar with machine learning to engage with some aspects of it to do the necessary analysis.  What I like most about this is how easy it is to test different variables in your model to ensure you can create the best possible predictive model. The blending of spatial analysis, stats, and machine learning is really really interesting.

 

I can definitely imagine using the Forest-Based Classification and Aggregation tool in real-world scenarios. My "real-world scenarios" will still be focused on academia and research for quite a few more years but I suspect I will be using this tool a lot as my proposed research for my doctorate is focused on creating a predictive model to evaluate spatial injustice in rural communities in the USA. I certainly plan to use this tool and similar ones as the foundation for my research.

# Final Reflection

My interest in geospatial analysis has continued to grow over the past semester. As an incoming PhD student in the Architecture department at Carnegie Mellon I realize the potential of utilizing GIS with my research. I am particularly interested in furthering my understanding of predictive modeling in GIS and using my background in statistics to conduct more indepth analyses.
