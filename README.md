# AboutMe
  I am a second year masters student at CMU. I enjoy traveling, reading, and eating lots of good 
  food! My favorite restaurants in town are Bahn Mi and Ti, and Morcillas in Lawrenceville! I don't 
  drink coffee but I am a BIG tea drinker.
  
# What I hope to learn
  
  I really enjoyed my intro to GIS class i took in the fall semester of 2021. I am really interested in
  exploring spatial in/justice and I think this class will allow me to expand on my current skills and learn
  some new ones to be able to conduct high-quality analyses.

# Final Reflection

My interest in geospatial analysis has continued to grow over the past semester. As an incoming PhD student in the Architecture department at Carnegie Mellon I realize the potential of utilizing GIS with my research. I am particularly interested in furthering my understanding of predictive modeling in GIS and using my background in statistics to conduct more indepth analyses.
