# Question

Did working through the exercise give you a broader understanding for how decision trees and the forest-based method work, and what a predictive model tries to do?  Can you imagine using the Forest-Based Classification and Aggregation tool in a real-world scenario?

# Response

I am actually really excited to know about this feature, as this will be incredibly useful for future research projects. At first I was a bit confused as I was visualizing the decision trees we discussed in ManSci 3, 
but I do now see their similarities. This exercise helped me get a better understanding of decision trees from both a management science perspective and now a spatial analysis perspective! 
From my understanding, individual decision trees create a certain predictive model and the Forest-Based method tool aggregates all of these decision trees to create a single prediction based on the validity of the training data.
Esri makes it really easy and relatively user friendly to do pretty advanced analysis because of all of the back-end work ArcGIS does. This allows users who aren't necessarily familiar with machine learning to engage with some aspects of it to do the necessary analysis.  
What I like most about this is how easy it is to test different variables in your model to ensure you can create the best possible predictive model. The blending of spatial analysis, stats, and machine learning is really really interesting.

 
I can definitely imagine using the Forest-Based Classification and Aggregation tool in real-world scenarios. My "real-world scenarios" will still be focused on academia and research for quite a few more years but I suspect 
I will be using this tool a lot as my proposed research for my doctorate is focused on creating a predictive model to evaluate spatial injustice in rural communities in the USA. 
I certainly plan to use this tool and similar ones as the foundation for my research.
