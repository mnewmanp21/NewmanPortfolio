# Question

Where you you see using Notebooks in the future? How might you expand your own use of ArcGIS Pro to better leverage some of the more advanced graphing capabilities in the software?

# Response

Notebooks in ArcGIS is an exceptional tool that I plan to use quite frequently in my graduate research studies. Much of my research will include spatial analysis/ spatial data science so having the ability to write code that can be reused and tailored to different kinds of analyses will be incredibly beneficial. I found it particularly useful to be able to review and edit data within the notebook once you create a feature class to visualize the data. I am planning to use notebooks in my final project which will be a very preliminary analysis of the research I plan to conduct during my PhD. 

Pros of Notebook

  1-this tool allows people who are conducting advanced GIS research to do so more efficiently by writing code and editing data
  2-copying and tailoring analyses without having to manually go through all of the steps/functions in ArcGIS Pro
  3- sharing the code and analyses with partners/clients for them to conduct similar research

Cons of Notebook

  1- It requires a pretty medium to advanced knowledge of python. I only have taken one introductory python class but I believe if I wanted to really utilize all the functions and capabilities of Notebook I would have to take another class or self-teach myself python

Where Notebook is Applicable

  1- Unless you are highly skilled in python and/or how to use all of the capabilities of ArcGIS notebook I wouldn't recommend using it for basic map making/analysis in ArcGIS Pro
  2- When conducting analyses that alig more with spatial data science and advanced quantitative analysis OR having to repeat similar analyses multiple times with different data I believe Notebook would be especially useful
