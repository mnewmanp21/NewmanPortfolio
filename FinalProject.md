# Process Log

I used a process log to keep track of approximately how many hours it took to do the project. I used the standard rate of 100 dollars per hour to calculate the 
estimated cost for a project like this one. You can see my process log [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vvyBSfdtHltQKBgfWfR218SGUgBTPX6PR68hNxDE7XY/edit?usp=sharing)
